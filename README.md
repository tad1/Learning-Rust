# Learning-Rust
roadmap on learning rust dedicated for the advanced programmers, created by [tad1](https://github.com/tad1)  

(TODO: a sentence that it's learn yourself approach, which requires you to be curious about the mechanics in rust.)

## Stage 0: Fork
Fork this repo, so you can, even more, brag about your GitHub profile to the interviewer.

## Stage 1: Learn
(TODO: I don't like having a "Learn" stage, since you learn here all the time)
*a stage where you are getting know about Rust*  
Go, and clone [rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings).  
Create a list where you will keep track of all stuff you learn about Rust (it's required by 2nd Stage). See an [example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tad1/Learning-Rust/main/Somewhat%20List.md)  


## Stage 2: Recall and Explore
*a stage where you are getting used to Rust*  
Rustlings are great to get started. Now it's time to explore what the Rust has to offer, and to find it's limits.

(TODO: before noting about exploring, write about testing yourself if you know how things works, and to learn more about stuff you don't)

An approach is simple: **be curious**
Constantly ask ask questions like: **What will happen ....?**, **Is it possible to ...?**, **Does that means we can do X?**
And find the answers by writing programs in Rust and reading the docs.

- [ ] TODO: add more specific examples for questions 

## Stage 3: Reinforce
(todo: update the name, it's inrelevant since you learn much more about Rust and non-Rust stuff - Practical Useage? or something like that?)
*a stage where you try to learn to do the handstand but I yeet wood logs into you*</br>

(TODO: short sentence that you have a basic comprehension on Rust).
Now it's time to put that (TODO: more specific) into practice.
(TODO: I don't like the suggestion that you did not had any practice in previous stages; while you actually mostly done practice)

(TODO: note, that in this is the meat of the roadmap; and it will resolve on Quest-Tree [Yes! the quest tree!] + that you will explore a lot of fields - Like embedded systems, Audio, Real-Time and other)
