# Marshaling

\- What the fuck is ***marhalling***? It's something about *marshmallow*?
Then it's time to explore the web. Check wiki, any article you feel appealing, or even a video with your favourite Indian tutor 

Check:
- [ ] I know what we are talking about. 

The task is to marshal and unmarshal data between program and file.
    or in other words: add saving and loading for your list to/from file (as trait)

> Note: Remember it's **your** journey. Feel free to break the rules, and go wild sometimes.
> These limitation are more like guidelines for you to have a clear goal.

Rules:
- Learn about Rust crate repository; Don't write your own marshaller/serializer, the challenge is to find out one that will do the job.
- Use only documentation (can be any documentation), rust books, and source code. 
- Don't use any "how to ... in Rust" materials, like articles, or tutorials.
    *But when you explore solutions feel free to explore the web.*
