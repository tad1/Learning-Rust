(Optional, this is my personal recommendation)\
\
**Step 0:** Create a directory `DevTools` (I recommend putting that in your user directory, eventually on root / C drive).\
**Step 1:** Add it to your PATH.\
\
How do I use the `DevTools`?\
I put all there of the tools and scripts I've obtained and created.\
For example, this is how my `DevTools` on Windows OS looks like:\
DevTools/\
├── antlr4.bat\
├── input.txt\
├── remedybg.exe\
├── sfxr.exe\
├── tdl.exe\
├── runhaskell.exe\
└── youtube-dl.exe\
\
It's much easier to find, add, and manage my toolkit. Once it's set up, it's done.\
And the most important one: I have access to all files everywhere. I can type in either in the terminal or in the directory URL.\

**Step 2:** Add build of your todolist to `DevTools`.
