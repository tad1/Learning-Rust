(Optional, this is my personal recommendation)

**Step 0:** Create a directory `DevTools` (I recommend putting that in your user directory, eventually on root / C drive).
**Step 1:** Add it to your PATH.

How I use the `DevTools`?
I put there all of tools and scripts I've obtained and created.
For example this is how my `DevTools` on Windows OS looks like:
DevTools/
├── antlr4.bat
├── input.txt
├── remedybg.exe
├── sfxr.exe
├── tdl.exe
├── runhaskell.exe
└── youtube-dl.exe

It's much easier to find, add, and manage my toolkit. Once it's set up, it's done.
And the most important one: I have access to all files everywhere. I can type in either in terminal, or in directory URL.

**Step 2:** Add build of your todolist to `DevTools`.
