### Stage1: Guided Introduction

Go and clone [rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) anywhere you want.
Let me explain the purpose of the List.

When you go thought [rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) you will have open a list of things you learned, and things that you want to checkout in [Stage 2]().

Keep the list to bare minimum, it's not a place where you write entire lessons you learned.
But I do recommend you to write down things you learned, for a better reinforce.

If rust feels to you unnatural. You should approach in "Always has been" approach.
Give it a break for month, reset your rustlings, and start over again.

But if you are just confused about one specific mechanic of rust leave that for [Stage 2](), you will have an oppurtunity to mess up with that.
